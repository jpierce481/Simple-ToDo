(July 14, 2012)
This app was developed as my first mobile device app.  The goal was to obtain Understanding of Titanium Studio, Apple Xcode,
and SQLite.  

Changes to the sample code include:

 - New intro page with Pierce Computing Consulting logo,

 - New titles were added for tab options,

 - Added sort of open ToDo items,

 - Added page background color for My ToDo List (Android),

 - and other minor changes.
